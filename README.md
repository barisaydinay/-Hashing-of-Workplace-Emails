# -Hashing-of-Workplace-Emails
It aims to practice the hash tables, especially collision resolution with open addressing. My main task in this project is to develop a hash table to store some of the emails that I read before  using the C programming language

Let’s say I want to keep the emails that I read in the first project stored in a database, but you 
do not want them to be stored so blatantly on a normal table, especially when considering the 
performance advantages of hash tables when your system would hypothetically need to keep track 
of thousands of emails. 

In this project, I will be developing a hash table with specific hashing techniques. The system 
shall be able to perform the following functionalities:
1. Read emails from files and put them in a hash table
2. Search for an email by taking the ID and sender’s name
3. Print table

THIS IS A CONSOLE APPLICATION ON CODEBLOCKS!
